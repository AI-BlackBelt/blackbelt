Formally, given inputs $\mathbf{X}$ and outputs $\mathbf{y}$, we want to find a function $f$ such that $\mathbf{y}=f(\mathbf{X})$.
- in classification, the set of possible output values is finite and *symbolic*.
- in regression, the set of possible output values is infinite and **numerical**.

## K-Nearest neighbors

Predict the average output value among the $K$ closest neighbors to the input $\mathbf{x}$.

```python
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier
clf = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=5)

## Naive Bayes

Idea: apply the Bayes rule to make predictions for $y$ given $\mathbf{x}$.

# Preprocessing

Not only the performance on your system depends on the algorithm you pick, but also on how you **prepare** the data.

- How should you treat missing values?
- Does the scale of the features matter?
- How do you encode categorical/symbolic features into numerical values?
